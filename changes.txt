Writing down some changes so you don't have to figure out what I did to the site buddy

--> oct 15
1. changed fonts to be this new londrina - gonna keep the about.html body as roboto mono cus its C L E A N lookin
    a. also added the light weight version for body text to separate from titles.
    b. making most the text black unless its a header as well
    c. resizing fonts to use rem instead of px

2. adding more style sheets for things specific to certain pages. doesn't do anything but i think it might make the css easier to reason about. 

3. got rid of the hover zoom for a minute cus it was creating scroll bar issues
