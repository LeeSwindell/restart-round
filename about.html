            <p>Billy: As a former statistics major, I mentally approach games like an optimization problem. What strategy will give the greatest probability of success? And what random events can completely throw that strategy upside down? And then I hope that those random events occur because that's what makes games fun. Most of my favorite memories gaming are from the ridiculous turns no one saw coming.<br><br>Whether it's complicated co-op games that take hours to play, superhero-themed deck builders, or party games, I'm always willing to try something new. But once I lose, you will catch me reading the rule book front to back, trying to find a new angle we hadn't considered.</p>

            <p>Brian: I love games! I grew up playing millions of games with my family, learning math from Monopoly (deal out the properties, it's way faster) and diplomacy from Risk (don't make a deal with my older brother Jake). I've come to learn firsthand how much games can do - they bring people together, engage and uplift them, and reveal their inner personalities. It was through games that I came to know and love the friends behind Restart Round, and in discussing and playtesting our own games it feels we're back in the college dining hall, our faces beaming and our aspirations inexorable. Let's make some games!</p>

            <p>Lee: Hey fellas, I'm Lee! I play games for that singular moment where hours of work, close competition, and focus all collide and it comes down to one 50/50 dice roll to decide who's going to call the game 'unfair', 'rigged', and 'complete bulls***'. And then playing the same game 6 more times because it was actually amazing.</p>
